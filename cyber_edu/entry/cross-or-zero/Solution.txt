There is the following string in the code:
dHNkdktTAVUHAABUA1VWVgIHBAlSBAFTBAMFUwECAgcAAAFWAFUFCFMACFFUAwQAVgBSBwQJBVZTAFYGCQYHVQABB1IJTQ

I used some magic on cyberchef. If you decode it from base64 and used the brute force XOR option you get the flag
The hint should have gave it away, but for me it didn't. The key for the XOR encryption is the character '0'.

What I learned:
	some python functions and concepts while analizying the programm
	xor encryption (Google it! It's good stuff)
