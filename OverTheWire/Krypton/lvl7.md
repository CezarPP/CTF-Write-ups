# Level 7
## Having a known cipher text attack, meaning we have an app that encodes whatever we provide it, lets us input a string like 'A'*50
## We notice a pattern, the As become EICTDGYIYZKTHNSIRFXYCPFUEOCKRN then it repeats
## This is the key for a Vingere cipher which lets us decode our password
