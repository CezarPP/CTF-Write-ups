# this displays a character art
# we make the terminal very small so that more will actually work on the graphic and let us execute a text editor(press v)  like vim which will let us read /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26 (:r /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26)

# to get a shell we, in vim,  :set shell = /bin/bash and then :shell
